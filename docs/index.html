            <p>
                This privacy policy is provided for Apple App Store and Google Play compliance.
                Subscription Tracker does not collect, transmit, or sell personal information. All data
                you enter stays on your device.
            </p>
        </section>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <p>Subscription Tracker does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information, usage data, or analytics.</p>
        <p>The app operates entirely offline and stores all data locally on your device using SQLite database. The only data stored includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscription names, prices, and URLs that you manually enter</li>
            <li>Your app preferences (currency, language, view settings) stored locally on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>

        <h2>How we use information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any information, we do not use any personal data. All subscription data you enter is used solely within the app on your device to display your subscriptions and calculate totals.</p>

        <h2>Data storage and security</h2>
        <p>
            All data you enter in the app is stored locally on your device's storage using SQLite database. We do not
            operate backend servers for storing your data, and we do not have access to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your data is protected by your device's built-in security measures. We recommend keeping your device
            protected with a passcode, biometric authentication, or other security measures provided by your device
            manufacturer.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
            The app may display website favicons (small icons) by loading them from Google's favicon service
            (google.com/s2/favicons). This service is used solely to display visual icons for subscription websites
            and does not involve transmitting any personal data or subscription information. The favicon requests
            only include the domain name of the subscription URL you entered, and no other personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google's privacy policy applies to their favicon service. We do not control how Google handles data
            from these requests. You can review Google's privacy policy at
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The app requests the following permission:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network state</strong>: Used to check your device's internet connectivity status. This permission does not allow the app to access your network traffic or transmit any data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The app does not request access to camera, microphone, location, contacts, or any other sensitive permissions.
        </p>

        <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete individual subscriptions at any time within the app</li>
            <li>You can uninstall the app to remove all stored data from your device</li>
            <li>Data is retained on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you would like to request assistance with data deletion or have questions about your data, please contact us using the information provided in the Contact section below.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing of information</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit any data with third parties because we do not collect it. Your subscription data remains on your device and is never sent to our servers or any external services.</p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to access</strong>: You can view all your data directly within the app</li>
            <li><strong>Right to deletion</strong>: You can delete any subscription or uninstall the app to remove all data</li>
            <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong>: Since data is stored locally, you have full control and can export it if needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or wish to exercise these rights, please contact us using the information provided below.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Subscription Tracker is not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable age of consent in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect
            personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>International users</h2>
        <p>
            This app is designed to work locally on your device regardless of your location. Since we do not collect or transmit any data, no data crosses international borders. All data processing occurs entirely on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will revise the effective date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your continued use of the app after any changes to this policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.
        </p>
